A console-based Primary School Student Management System built with Java and MySQL.

This project demonstrates a clean layered architecture using Model, DAO, Service, and UI separation(not yet implemented).  
It supports basic CRUD operations such as adding, viewing, editing, and deleting students, with data persisted using JDBC and MySQL.

The goal of this project is to practice real-world Java application structure, database integration, and separation of concerns, serving as a foundation for future GUI or web-based versions.
